## What I Did
- Started SSH server
- Connected using SSH
- Transferred a file from VM to host
- Verified the file transfer

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu (VirtualBox)

## What I Learned
I learned how SSH works, how authentication works, and how file transfer is done securely between systems.

This is my first step into cybersecurity labs.
